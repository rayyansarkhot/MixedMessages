# Random Color Generator ðŸŽ¨

## Description

This website generates and displays three random colors from a collection pool: red, blue, brown, gray, black, pink, purple, orange, and gray.

## Features

The color strips rendered on the page show colors and name of that color within the strip.

## How to use

Click generate button at the bottom of the screen to generate new colors.

## Technologies

I used **HTML** to create the structure of the website with the title, headers, and button.
**CSS** was used to style and color these HTML elements.
**Javascript** was used to generate random colors from arrays of strings, which had color names, and change HTML elements' CSS attributes accordingly.
